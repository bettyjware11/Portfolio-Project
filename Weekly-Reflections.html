        <p>I am very excited to have been chosen for the opportunity to be in the Beta class.
        I am also nervous because I hardly have any coding experience except through Excel
        formulas like concatenation.</p>

    <p>This past week seemed to be very fast paced. I picked up on a couple of new concepts
        pretty well but I am still struggling with most of them. I have been doing more
        independent study this week and it has been helping. I have been so filled with
        new concepts that I have actually been dreaming of different coding terminology.
        I am feeling a little more confident as I have been interacting with my classmates. </p>

    <p> We started making functions work within functions. I am feeling pressure to complete
        assignments faster. am wondering at this point if I am going to be able to understand
        this language. I have been putting more time into independent study. </p>

    <p>I am seeing some improvement in the way I am completing assignments. I am at least
        learning to understand the requirements better now. At first, I was more focused
        on trying to get at least something done on each problem or exercise; but now I see
        that it is more important to finish one than to have two incomplete ones.</p>

    <p>Very challenging. Adding event listeners was tough for me. I have made this the main
        topic for study this weekend. Even though I am having some trouble, I am still
        confident that I can grasp the various concepts being thrown at me. </p>

    <p>Currently working on this week doing the first Project...</p>
