Noon status update:
I changed the weekly reflections table to a grid.
I changed the picture on the home page and commented out two divs because I'm not sure that
I am going to use them. Instead I put all my buttons on the homepage.
I took the background color off the buttons and changed the font to black.
I embedded my resume in the Resume HTML.
I linked my email on the contact HTML page.

Afternoon status update:
Edited the Skills HTML to an ordered list.
I added background color to the Skills CSS page as well.
I created a google contact form and added it to the Contact HTML page.
I added a link to Project 1 to the Projects HTML page.
